(ELLIPSE MACRO CHC)
((c)Michael Dillio for Praxis Mechatronics 2024)

(---------OPTIMIZED FOR HAAS CONTROL-----------)

(THIS PROGRAM TAKES THREE INPUT VARIABLES AND RUNS A)
(SUBROUTINE THAT TRACES OUT AN ELLIPSE WITH THE DIMENSIONS)
(OUTLINED IN VARIABLES #1 AND #2. )
(TO ADJUST THE SIZE OF THE ELLIPSE, ADJUST THOSE VARS)
(#3 IS THE "RESOLUTION" VARIABLE.)
(THE PROGRAM STEPS THROUGH VALUES FOR X AT #3 INTERVALS)
(AND SOLVES FOR Y WITH EVERY INTERVAL)
 
#1= 7.0 (MAJOR RADIUS 'A') 
#2= 1. (MINOR RADIUS 'B') 
#3= 0.01 (SEGMENT SIZE IN X) 

(CALCULATE CENTER OFFSETS FOR F1 AND F2, KNOWN AS 'C') 
#4= SQRT[ [ #1 * #1 ] - [ #2 * #2 ] ] (C) 
#5= 0 - #4 (F1) 
#6= 0 + #4 (F2)
